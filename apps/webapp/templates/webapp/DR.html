                <p class="lead">Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that can cause vision loss and blindness in
                        people who have diabetes. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of
                        tissue in the back of your eye). <br>

                        If you have diabetes, it’s important for you to get a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least
                        once a year. Diabetic retinopathy may not have any symptoms at first but finding it early can
                        help you take steps to protect your vision.<br>

                        Managing your diabetes by staying physically active, eating healthy, and taking your medicine
                        can also help you prevent or delay vision loss</i>
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                        In the early stages of diabetic retinopathy, the walls of the blood vessels in your retina
                        weaken. Tiny bulges protrude from the vessel walls, sometimes leaking or oozing fluid and blood
                        into the retina. Nerve fibers in the retina may swell, producing white spots in the retina. As
                        diabetic retinopathy progresses, new blood vessels may grow and threaten your vision</i>

                <ul>
                    <h2 class="display-4">There are two types of diabetic retinopathy-</h2><br>
                    <li class="lead"><strong> Early diabetic retinopathy.</strong> In this more common form — called nonproliferative diabetic
                        retinopathy (NPDR) — new blood vessels aren't growing (proliferating).

                        When you have NPDR, the walls of the blood vessels in your retina weaken. Tiny bulges
                        (microaneurysms) protrude from the vessel walls of the smaller vessels, sometimes leaking fluid
                        and blood into the retina. Larger retinal vessels can begin to dilate and become irregular in
                        diameter, as well. NPDR can progress from mild to severe, as more blood vessels become blocked.

                        Nerve fibers in the retina may begin to swell. Sometimes the central part of the retina (macula)
                        begins to swell (macular edema), a condition that requires treatment</i></li><br><br> <br>
                    <li class="lead"><strong>Advanced diabetic retinopathy.</strong>
                        Diabetic retinopathy can progress to this more severe type, known
                        as proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In this type, damaged blood vessels close off, causing
                        the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels in the retina, and can leak into the clear, jelly-like
                        substance that fills the center of your eye (vitreous).

                        Eventually, scar tissue stimulated by the growth of new blood vessels may cause the retina to
                        detach from the back of your eye. If the new blood vessels interfere with the normal flow of
                        fluid out of the eye, pressure may build up in the eyeball. This can damage the nerve that
                        carries images from your eye to your brain (optic nerve), resulting in glaucoma.</i>

        <div class="col">
            <p class="lead">
                Diabetic retinopathy can lead to other serious eye conditions:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li class="lead">Diabetic macular edema (DME). Over time, about half of people with diabetic
                            retinopathy will develop DME. DME happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid,
                            causing swelling in the macula (a part of the retina). If you have DME, your vision will
                            become blurry because of the extra fluid in your macula.</i></li>
                    <li class="lead">Neovascular glaucoma. Diabetic retinopathy can cause abnormal blood vessels to
                            grow out of the retina and block fluid from draining out of the eye. This causes a type of
                            glaucoma.</i></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div> <br>
        <h1 class="display-4"> What causes diabetic retinopathy? </h1>
        <div class="col">
            <p class="lead">
                Diabetic retinopathy is caused by high blood sugar due to diabetes. Over time, having too much sugar
                    in your blood can damage your retina — the part of your eye that detects light and sends signals to
                    your brain through a nerve in the back of your eye (optic nerve). <br>

                    Diabetes damages blood vessels all over the body. The damage to your eyes starts when sugar blocks
                    the tiny blood vessels that go to your retina, causing them to leak fluid or bleed. To make up for
                    these blocked blood vessels, your eyes then grow new blood vessels that don’t work well. <br> These
                    new blood vessels can leak or bleed easily.</i>
